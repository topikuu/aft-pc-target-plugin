Building and Installing
=======================

Home Page
---------
The project is hosted on the website of the Intel Open Source Technology
Center, 01.org :  http://01.org/AFT
Note: this package is not intended to be installed directly, rather it
should be pulled in as dependency from other components.


Premise
-------
The SW has been tested with OpenSUSE 13.2 64 bits.
Other distros should work equally well, since the code is 100% python, but
they are not confirmed.
For example, some issues might arise with the packaging, when using Other
distros still based on rpms, because they might have different naming and/or
breakdown of the dependency.


Configuring and installing from rpm repository
----------------------------------------------
To use the ready-made packages, add and enable the rpm repo:
[XXX placeholder to download area from 01.org]


Installing from sources
-----------------------
For the latest version of the SW, check the proejct page on github:
https://github.com/01org-AutomatedFlasherTester/aft-pc-plugin
For creating (s)rpms packages, please refer to [XXX placeholder]
Alternatively, on non-rpm distros, it is possible to install by using directly
the setup.py file in the root directory of the repo.



Setting up the test harness
---------------------------
This plugin relies on 2 system services that must be configured:


* dnsmasquerade
It must be setup to provide DNS and DHCP services on a specific port, used
to create a local network between the testing harness and all the DUTs.
The testing harness can be optionally configured (through iptables) to be also
the gateway for the DUTs, by setting up rules for IP masquerading.
It is _very_ important to limit the DHCP server exclusively to the port(s) used
for the local network(s) with the DUT, to avoid introducing a rogue DHCP server
in the primary network used by the test harness.
The default config file provided by dnsmasq is already very explicative, but
further help can be found from the manpage of the service.

* nfs server
The home directory of the linux user that will run the test cases must be shared
over the local network, so that the DUTs can access the test images.
The nfs share can be configured following the instructions from:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo

The default user is "tester" - Example of /etc/exports :

   /home/tester    *(crossmnt,ro,root_squash,sync,no_subtree_check)
Other locations/users are possible, but this will require patching the tester and
the /etc/fstab file in the support OS.


In both cases, it's a recommended to configure both services to start
automatically at the boot of the testing harness, so to avoid downtime of the 
tester due to a reboot.
